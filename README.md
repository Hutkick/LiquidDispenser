# LiquidDispenser
Automatic Liquid Dispenser

In this project, I'm trying to make an Automatic Liquid Dispenser using:

 - An arduino IR Sensor
 - A Water Pump motor
 - A BD140 Transistor
 - A 1K Ohm Resistor

The elctronics is basic and is just a quick soldering which are shown in the pictures.

The main reason of this project is to perform my skills in 3D modelling.
Therefore, using Fusion 360, I made the shell of the Liquid Dispenser which will be 3D  Printed just after.

To make the Liquid Dispenser :
First make the electronic connection as shown in the pictures in the Electronics folder.
Then print the 3D Files which are located in the 3D Files folder.
Finally assemble.
